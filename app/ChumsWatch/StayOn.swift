/// `setExtendedIdleTime:disablesSleepGesture:wantsAutorotation:`, with 23 s and the wrist-down gesture off when on,
/// 15 s and the gesture on when off (WatchKit's disassembly). We call the same method with our own idle time, without
/// turning the picture. It's not public API, which is fine for an app you build and sign yourself (it never goes to the App Store).
